# Gothenberg

Are you looking for a simple Golang tool that will convert your Markdown, which contains Python code,
into an HTML file and you would like it to be styled with TailwindCSS Typography?

If yes, look no further because Gothenberg is exactly that!

## Requirements

- I tested this with Go version 1.21
- An OS that uses the forward slash in file paths

## How to use Gothenberg

1. Put your Markdown files into the text folder
2. Add the order of the file names, without '.md', into the order.txt file.
3. Run `go run .` 
4. The output should be generated in the output folder.
